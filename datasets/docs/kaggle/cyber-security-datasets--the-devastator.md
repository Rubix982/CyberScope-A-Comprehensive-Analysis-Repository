## Cyber-security Datasets

A collection of public datasets of cyberthreats.

The collection is classified into categories according to the source of the
relevant information, such as network traffic datasets, host based datasets,
malware or fraud reports, or a special section for datasets that cannot be
categorized according to a specific source.

> **Credits:** The collection is maintained by

Thank you in advance. I am also happy to share with you a dataset on **malware
detection in network traffic data**. This dataset contains network packets
captured from devices infected by various types of malware. The dataset was
cleaned by myself and is ready to use for analysis and modeling.

The dataset can be used for various tasks such as:

  * Malware classification: identify the type of malware based on the network traffic patterns 
  * Malware detection: detect anomalous or malicious network traffic from infected devices 
  * Malware analysis: understand the behavior and characteristics of different malware types 
  * Malware prevention: design and evaluate countermeasures to prevent or mitigate malware infections 

You can find the dataset here: <https://www.kaggle.com/dsv/6660994>

I hope you find this dataset useful and interesting.

Thank you in advance. I am also happy to share with you a dataset on **malware
detection in network traffic data**. This dataset contains network packets
captured from devices infected by various types of malware. The dataset was
cleaned by myself and is ready to use for analysis and modeling.

The dataset can be used for various tasks such as:

  * Malware classification: identify the type of malware based on the network traffic patterns 
  * Malware detection: detect anomalous or malicious network traffic from infected devices 
  * Malware analysis: understand the behavior and characteristics of different malware types 
  * Malware prevention: design and evaluate countermeasures to prevent or mitigate malware infections 

You can find the dataset here: <https://www.kaggle.com/dsv/6660994>

I hope you find this dataset useful and interesting.

relevant information, such as network traffic datasets, host based datasets,
malware or fraud reports, or a special section for datasets that cannot be
categorized according to a specific source.

Thank you in advance. I am also happy to share with you a dataset on **malware
detection in network traffic data**. This dataset contains network packets
captured from devices infected by various types of malware. The dataset was
cleaned by myself and is ready to use for analysis and modeling.

The dataset can be used for various tasks such as:

  * Malware classification: identify the type of malware based on the network traffic patterns 
  * Malware detection: detect anomalous or malicious network traffic from infected devices 
  * Malware analysis: understand the behavior and characteristics of different malware types 
  * Malware prevention: design and evaluate countermeasures to prevent or mitigate malware infections 

You can find the dataset here: <https://www.kaggle.com/dsv/6660994>

I hope you find this dataset useful and interesting.

relevant information, such as network traffic datasets, host based datasets,
malware or fraud reports, or a special section for datasets that cannot be
categorized according to a specific source.

## Cyber-security Datasets

A collection of public datasets of cyberthreats.

The collection is classified into categories according to the source of the
relevant information, such as network traffic datasets, host based datasets,
malware or fraud reports, or a special section for datasets that cannot be
categorized according to a specific source.

> **Credits:** The collection is maintained by

Thank you in advance. I am also happy to share with you a dataset on **malware
detection in network traffic data**. This dataset contains network packets
captured from devices infected by various types of malware. The dataset was
cleaned by myself and is ready to use for analysis and modeling.

The dataset can be used for various tasks such as:

  * Malware classification: identify the type of malware based on the network traffic patterns 
  * Malware detection: detect anomalous or malicious network traffic from infected devices 
  * Malware analysis: understand the behavior and characteristics of different malware types 
  * Malware prevention: design and evaluate countermeasures to prevent or mitigate malware infections 

You can find the dataset here: <https://www.kaggle.com/dsv/6660994>

I hope you find this dataset useful and interesting.
