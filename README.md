# CyberScope - A Comprehensive Analysis Repository

## Overview
Welcome to the **CyberScope - A Comprehensive Analysis Repository**, a centralized resource for collecting, analyzing, and experimenting with publicly available datasets in the cybersecurity domain. This repository is designed to facilitate exploratory data analysis, model building, and research for a wide variety of use cases, including intrusion detection, malware analysis, network traffic monitoring, phishing detection, and more.

## Objectives
This repository serves as a one-stop resource to:

1. **Centralize Access to Datasets**: Provide links and summaries for diverse cybersecurity datasets.
2. **Enable Analysis**: Develop scripts, tools, and notebooks to analyze and derive insights from these datasets.
3. **Foster Learning**: Encourage a deeper understanding of cybersecurity through practical, hands-on experimentation.
4. **Support Research**: Help researchers and enthusiasts in building models and conducting experiments in cybersecurity.
